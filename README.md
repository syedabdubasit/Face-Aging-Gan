IPA-CycleGAN — Face Aging with Identity Preservation
A deep learning project that realistically ages faces across 8 age groups while preserving the person's identity. Built with PyTorch · Trained on UTKFace · Evaluated on AgeDB-30

Overview
Given a face image, the model generates a realistic aged version of that person while keeping their identity recognizable. It learns the structural and textural changes that happen across decades of aging, without needing paired before/after images of the same person.

Input: A face photo
Output: The same person aged into a target age group (e.g., 20s → 60s)

Architecture
This is a custom GAN architecture combining several components:

Component	Role
FaceEncoder (ResNet50 backbone)	Separates facial content from identity
AgeEmbedder (MLP)	Learns an age-group style vector
U-Net Generator + AdaIN	Synthesizes aged face with style injection
Attention Gates	Focuses generation on age-relevant facial regions
ArcFace (frozen ResNet50)	Identity preservation loss
Multi-Scale Discriminator + Spectral Norm	Stable adversarial training
CycleGAN loss	Enables unpaired training
Perceptual loss (VGG16)	Preserves high-frequency texture
The full loss combines: adversarial (WGAN-GP) + age classification + cycle-consistency + identity + perceptual + feature matching.

Datasets
Dataset	Purpose	Link
UTKFace	Training (~14,500 images across 8 age groups)	Kaggle
AgeDB-30	Evaluation (500 images)	Kaggle
Images are grouped into 8 age ranges: 0–10, 11–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, 61–70, 71+.
The training set was balanced across groups and deduplicated using perceptual hashing.

Results
Metric	Score
CSIM (Cosine Identity Similarity)	~0.88
FID (Fréchet Inception Distance)	~51
CSIM of 0.88 indicates identity is well-preserved across age transformations. FID of ~51 reflects reasonable image quality given the training constraints.

Limitations
This is a semester project built under real constraints:

Reduced training data — UTKFace was downsampled per group due to time and GPU limitations. The full dataset would likely improve output quality.
Limited epochs — training was run to ~70–100 epochs on free Colab GPU. The model was still improving at cutoff; more compute would reduce FID further.
128×128 resolution — outputs can appear soft at larger display sizes. Higher resolution training requires more compute than was available.
Discrete age groups — the model operates on 8 age buckets rather than continuous age values, so transitions between groups are not perfectly smooth.
Checkpoint not included — trained weights are too large for GitHub. Re-train using the provided notebooks.
No paired training data — UTKFace has no before/after pairs of the same person, so CycleGAN-style unpaired training is used.
Setup
All notebooks run on Google Colab with a GPU runtime.

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
